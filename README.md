# Databricks_documentation
# 1. Databricks
Databricks is a cloud-based unified data analytics platform designed for big data processing, analytics, data engineering, and machine learning. It provides a collaborative environment built on Apache Spark.

# 1.1 Workspace UI
The Databricks Workspace UI is the web interface where users interact with all Databricks features. It provides access to notebooks, jobs, data, clusters, ML components, and more.

# Key areas of the UI:

Sidebar – Navigation for workspace components (Workspace, Data, Compute, Jobs, etc.)

Main Canvas – Displays opened notebooks, files, and cluster dashboards.

Toolbar – Options like run commands, cell execution, settings, cluster selection.
# 1.2 Overview of UI Components
# Important UI components include:

| **Component**          | **Description**                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Workspace**          | Stores notebooks, folders, dashboards, and repos     |
| **Data**               | View, upload, and explore datasets and tables        |
| **Compute (Clusters)** | Manage Spark clusters used to run jobs and notebooks |
| **Repos**              | Connect workspaces with Git version control          |
| **Jobs**               | Schedule automated workflows and pipelines           |
| **Marketplace**        | Access various data and package providers            |
| **Settings**           | User profile, API tokens, and configuration          |

# 1.3 Workspaces
A Workspace organizes all user objects, including:
Notebooks

Libraries

Repos

ML models

Dashboards

Folder structures

Workspaces allow role-based access control for users and teams.

# 1.4 Notebooks
A Databricks Notebook is an interactive environment used to:

* Write and run code (Python, SQL, Scala, R)
  
* Visualize data
  
* Document workflows using Markdown
  
* Execute commands on a selected Spark cluster

* Notebooks support cell-based execution.

# 1.5 Libraries
Libraries are software packages installed to enhance your workspace or cluster.

# Common library types:

* Python packages (.whl or PyPI)
  
* JAR files (Scala/Java)
  
* CRAN R packages
  
# Libraries may be installed:
At the cluster level

Notebook/session level
# 1.6 Data
# The Data section lets users:

View datasets and schemas

Upload CSV, JSON, Parquet, and other files

Access tables and databases in the metastore

Ingest data into the Lakehouse
# Data may be stored in:

DBFS (Databricks File System)

External cloud storage (S3, ADLS, GCS)

Hive tables
# 1.7 Clusters
A Databricks cluster is a Spark-based compute engine where notebook code executes.
# Cluster features:
Distributed data processing

Support for auto-scaling

Managed Spark environment

Integration with Databricks runtime versions
# 2. Workspace Navigation
   # 2.1 Creating and Managing Notebooks
Click Workspace → Create → Notebook

Give the notebook a name

Choose default language (Python/SQL/Scala/R)

Attach a cluster to start running code

# Management actions:

Rename, delete, move, import/export

Run interactively or schedule in Jobs

# 2.2 Uploading and Managing Data
# Ways to upload data:
Drag & Drop via the Data UI

Using DBFS CLI

Using Databricks File browser

# Using Spark code:
df = spark.read.csv("/FileStore/tables/data.csv")

Data can then be transformed, queried, or registered as a table.

# 2.3 Managing Clusters
# Users can:

* Create new clusters
  
* Start/stop clusters
  
* Monitor usage and logs
  
* Apply policies and limits
  
Cluster actions available from the Compute section.

# 2.4 Accessing Libraries
# Installed libraries can be:
Viewed in the Libraries tab within a cluster UI

Installed via upload

Pulled from repositories (Maven, PyPI, CRAN)

# 2.5 Collaboration and Sharing
# Databricks provides real-time collaboration:

Multiple users can work in the same notebook

Role-based access control (view, edit, run)

Activity history and notebook permissions

# 2.6 Sharing Notebooks
# Steps:

1 Open a Notebook

2 Click Share

3 Add user emails or assign permissions:

* Can View
  
* Can Run
  
* Can Edit
 
* Can Manage
# 2.7 Collaborative Editing
# Multiple users can:

See real-time cursor movements

Chat through comments

Work simultaneously like Google Docs
# 2.8 Version History
# Databricks automatically stores versions of notebooks:

Undo changes using Revision History

Compare old and new versions

Restore previous versions anytime
